# guessNum
Basic number guessing game in python

To play (through terminal):

-Open terminal and navigate to the project folder 

-Run the following command:
python guessNum.py

-Take a guess at the randomly generated number (between 0-20 inclusive)

-If your guess was too low, too high, or right on the money, the terminal will print a message informing you of the status of your guess

-Guess as many times as it takes to hit the jackpot

Hint: 
Think of this exercise as a basic search operation, and play around with the efficiency of different search algorithms (I reccomend binary)
